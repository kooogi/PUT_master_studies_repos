## Subject-Specific Project Overviews

### 1. Frontend Development (FD) - sem3

This section highlights my experience with modern frontend technologies and frameworks. The projects in this section demonstrate:

- **Single Page Applications (SPA):** Building SPAs using Angular, React, and Svelte.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Designing reusable and maintainable UI components.
- **State Management:** Implementing state management solutions in frontend applications.
- **RESTful API Integration:** Connecting frontend apps to backend services.
- **Styling:** Using CSS, SCSS, and modern styling techniques for responsive design.
- **Tooling:** Utilizing build tools, linters, and development servers for efficient workflows.

The goal of this course is to provide hands-on experience in building interactive, user-friendly web applications using the latest frontend technologies.

### 2. Quality Management and Experimental Software Engineering (QMESE) - sem2

This section contains projects focused on applying principles and methodologies from both Quality Management and Experimental Software Engineering. The course aims to provide the knowledge in:

**Quality Management:**
_ Understanding the definition of quality, its importance and costs.
_ Application of continuous improvement paradigms (Plan-Do-Check-Act, TQM).
_ Knowledge of Quality Management Systems (ISO 9000, ISO 9001).
_ Awareness of process maturity assessment based on CMMI and SCAMPI.
_ Understanding of service management with ITIL.
_ Performing reviews and inspections on processes and software.

**Experimental Software Engineering:**

- Applying empirical research methods in software engineering.
- Understanding relationships between observations, facts, and theories.
- Formulating hypotheses and research questions.
- Applying quantitative and qualitative methods.
- Using measurement scales (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio).
- Designing controlled experiments.
- Formulating experiment hypotheses, variable selection (dependent and independent).
- Collecting data, validating it, and analysing using statistical methods.
- Using meta-analysis, surveys, and case studies.

### 3. Software Design and Modeling (SDM) - sem1

This section focuses on the design and modeling aspects of software development, with an emphasis on object-oriented principles, design patterns and UML. This course aims to enhance my skills in:

- **Designing Software:** Applying best practices and design patterns for creating robust software systems.
- **Object-Oriented Concepts:** Utilizing concepts like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Design Patterns:** Implementing and utilizing design patterns to solve recurring design problems.
- **UML Modeling:** Creating various diagrams (Class, Sequence, Use Case, etc.) to model and visualize software.
- **Evaluating Design Quality**: Apply software metrics to evaluate and improve the design.
- **Source Code Quality**: Applying best practices for software design and source code.

### 4. Technologies of Software Development (TSD) - sem1

This section showcases my proficiency in various software development technologies and tools, covering a wide range of topics, including:

- **.NET Framework:** Understanding and using core concepts of the .NET Framework.
- **Object-Relational Mapping:** Using Entity Framework for database interaction.
- **Graphical User Interfaces:** Building GUIs with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).
- **Functional Programming:** Using F# for functional programming paradigms.
- **Dynamic Programming with Ruby:** Developing web applications using Ruby on Rails.
- **Cloud Applications:** Deploying applications using Windows Azure.
- **Distributed Programming:** Using Akka.NET for building distributed systems.
- **Web Development:** Using ASP.NET for web development.
- **Scripting Programming:** Utilizing PowerShell for scripting tasks.
- **Development Layers:** Designing data, interface and communication layer in software.

The aim of this course is to develop my skills in solving problems related to software creation using different technologies, develop teamwork skills and ability to learn new technologies.
