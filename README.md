# Poznan University of Technology - Master's Level Projects Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of projects, assignments, and contributions completed during my Master's level studies at Poznan University of Technology. It showcases my learning journey and practical application of knowledge gained across three key subjects:

- **Quality Management and Experimental Software Engineering (QMESE)**
- **Technologies of Software Development (TSD)**
- **Software Design and Modeling (SDM)**

Each project provides insights into various aspects of software engineering, from theoretical concepts to practical implementations.

## Subject-Specific Project Overviews

### 1. Quality Management and Experimental Software Engineering (QMESE)

This section contains projects focused on applying principles and methodologies from both Quality Management and Experimental Software Engineering. The course aims to provide the knowledge in:

**Quality Management:**
_ Understanding the definition of quality, its importance and costs.
_ Application of continuous improvement paradigms (Plan-Do-Check-Act, TQM).
_ Knowledge of Quality Management Systems (ISO 9000, ISO 9001).
_ Awareness of process maturity assessment based on CMMI and SCAMPI.
_ Understanding of service management with ITIL.
_ Performing reviews and inspections on processes and software.

**Experimental Software Engineering:**

- Applying empirical research methods in software engineering.
- Understanding relationships between observations, facts, and theories.
- Formulating hypotheses and research questions.
- Applying quantitative and qualitative methods.
- Using measurement scales (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio).
- Designing controlled experiments.
- Formulating experiment hypotheses, variable selection (dependent and independent).
- Collecting data, validating it, and analysing using statistical methods.
- Using meta-analysis, surveys, and case studies.

### 2. Technologies of Software Development (TSD)

This section showcases my proficiency in various software development technologies and tools, covering a wide range of topics, including:

- **.NET Framework:** Understanding and using core concepts of the .NET Framework.
- **Object-Relational Mapping:** Using Entity Framework for database interaction.
- **Graphical User Interfaces:** Building GUIs with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).
- **Functional Programming:** Using F# for functional programming paradigms.
- **Dynamic Programming with Ruby:** Developing web applications using Ruby on Rails.
- **Cloud Applications:** Deploying applications using Windows Azure.
- **Distributed Programming:** Using Akka.NET for building distributed systems.
- **Web Development:** Using ASP.NET for web development.
- **Scripting Programming:** Utilizing PowerShell for scripting tasks.
- **Development Layers:** Designing data, interface and communication layer in software.

The aim of this course is to develop my skills in solving problems related to software creation using different technologies, develop teamwork skills and ability to learn new technologies.

### 3. Software Design and Modeling (SDM)

This section focuses on the design and modeling aspects of software development, with an emphasis on object-oriented principles, design patterns and UML. This course aims to enhance my skills in:

- **Designing Software:** Applying best practices and design patterns for creating robust software systems.
- **Object-Oriented Concepts:** Utilizing concepts like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Design Patterns:** Implementing and utilizing design patterns to solve recurring design problems.
- **UML Modeling:** Creating various diagrams (Class, Sequence, Use Case, etc.) to model and visualize software.
- **Evaluating Design Quality**: Apply software metrics to evaluate and improve the design.
- **Source Code Quality**: Applying best practices for software design and source code.

## How to Explore

1.  **Navigate to the relevant subject folder.**
2.  **Choose a project folder that interests you.**
3.  **Open the `README.md` within the project folder for detailed information about the project.**
4.  **Explore the source code and other files to gain a deeper understanding.**

## Contributions and Open Source

While this repository primarily serves as a showcase of my work at Poznan University of Technology, I am always eager to learn and contribute to the open-source community. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
