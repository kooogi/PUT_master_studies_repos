# Let's start

## :tada: Welcome

During these workshops, we will try to go through the most important functions of Docker,\
so that you can immediately apply this very popular tool in your daily work.

On this page you will find all the necessary materials:
- [slides from the presentation](/presentation.md),
- task descriptions,
- [link to the repository](https://github.com/drmikeman/tsd-docker-workshop).

Tasks can be performed in two ways:
- :bi-laptop: locally on the computer,
- :bi-cloud: in the cloud, using Github Codespaces.

## :dart: Workshop goals

The aim of this training is to introduce the concept of containerization along with learning a few practical ways of its application.
In addition to Docker, we will get to know the GitHub Codespaces service, which, based on containers, allows for the creation of remote programming environments (IDE).

After the workshops, we will know:
- how Docker differs from a virtual machine,
- what are images, containers, volumes,
- how to create Docker images on your own,
- how to run containers with web applications,
- how to create a codespace for a selected repository on GitHub,
- when to use Docker, and when Docker Compose,
- what are typical Docker use scenarios.

## :hammer_and_pick: Tools

List of tools we will use during the workshops:
- Docker Desktop,
- GitHub Codespaces :bi-github:,
- Visual Studio Code (GitHub),
- git :bi-git:,
- terminal :bi-terminal:,
- Vuepress, NodeJS - sample application,
- [GitHub account](https://github.com/) :bi-github:,
- [Docker Hub account](https://hub.docker.com/).

## :alarm_clock: Class schedule

- Presentation - Docker operation principles
- Demo - Codespace, running containers, most commonly used commands
- Tasks

## :wave: A few words about me

In short, I am a passionate programmer with a knack for scientific research.

I started programming as a child and never felt it was boring &mdash; probably because I always loved learning new things.

After work, I teach classes for students at Poznan University of Technology and conduct experiments that combine computers with people. Most of my research focuses on designing user-friendly programming language.

In my free time, I like to watch series and read books, usually with my wife by my side (when our son is sleeping).\
Playing football and hiking are my ways of dealing with fatigue and stress.

Lately, I have a craze for Generative AI, but more on that another time ;).
